# Typing Jumping
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a mini project work as a team. So we choose Typing Jumping which is a kind of typing game. We choose it becasue this game can be an entertainment and also improve our skill of typing.
# Decription
--------------------------------------------------------------
My project talk about the typing game. We use python to built it. We use python becasue it is a friendly language. Anyway we use some library such as pygame, random, string, math. These feature is really useful for us to develop our project. Pygame is a important part, pygame is a library for handle our project. Random is used to random letter. String is used to import alphabet and math is used to calculate. Although Python is a friendly language, but it challenge for use, becuase some of library we don't know at all. Espacailly, Pygame. So, we try hard to study new knowledge.
